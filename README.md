# Kids Memory Game 

representative image



# UX
The inspiration for this game was my daughter. I wanted to make a game that would have a good impact on a child's brain. As a parent I know how hard it is to keep children away from the screen, but sometimes this is inevitable. So I wanted to make a game that would be useful and fun at the same time.
I did a little research on memory games and found out that playing memory games can improve other brain functions, such as attention, concentration, and focus. Memory games give space to critical thinking and that helps children nurture their attention to detail.  
This project is intended for children from 2 -6 years.
